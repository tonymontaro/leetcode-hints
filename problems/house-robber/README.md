<p>You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and <b>it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night</b>.</p>

<p>Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight <b>without alerting the police</b>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> [1,2,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
&nbsp;            Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
