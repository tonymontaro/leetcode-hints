## [765. Couples Holding Hands (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/couples-holding-hands "情侣牵手")

<p>
N couples sit in 2N seats arranged in a row and want to hold hands.  We want to know the minimum number of swaps so that every couple is sitting side by side.  A <i>swap</i> consists of choosing <b>any</b> two people, then they stand up and switch seats. 
</p><p>
The people and seats are represented by an integer from <code>0</code> to <code>2N-1</code>, the couples are numbered in order, the first couple being <code>(0, 1)</code>, the second couple being <code>(2, 3)</code>, and so on with the last couple being <code>(2N-2, 2N-1)</code>.
</p><p>
The couples' initial seating is given by <code>row[i]</code> being the value of the person who is initially sitting in the i-th seat.

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br /><pre>
<b>Input:</b> row = [0, 2, 1, 3]
<b>Output:</b> 1
<b>Explanation:</b> We only need to swap the second (row[1]) and third (row[2]) person.
</pre></p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br /><pre>
<b>Input:</b> row = [3, 2, 0, 1]
<b>Output:</b> 0
<b>Explanation:</b> All couples are already seated side by side.
</pre></p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b>
<ol> 
<li> <code>len(row)</code> is even and in the range of <code>[4, 60]</code>.</li>
<li> <code>row</code> is guaranteed to be a permutation of <code>0...len(row)-1</code>.</li>
</ol>
