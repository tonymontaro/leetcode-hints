<p>You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are <strong>arranged in a circle.</strong> That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and&nbsp;<b>it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night</b>.</p>

<p>Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight <strong>without alerting the police</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> [2,3,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
&nbsp;            because they are adjacent houses.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> [1,2,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4

### Hints
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Since House[1] and House[n] are adjacent, they cannot be robbed together. Therefore, the problem becomes to rob either House[1]-House[n-1] or House[2]-House[n], depending on which choice offers more money. Now the problem has degenerated to the <a href ="https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/">House Robber</a>, which is already been solved.
