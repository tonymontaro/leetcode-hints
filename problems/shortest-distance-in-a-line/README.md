## [613. Shortest Distance in a Line (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-in-a-line "直线上的最近距离")

Table <code>point</code> holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
The shortest distance is &#39;1&#39; obviously, which is from point &#39;-1&#39; to &#39;0&#39;. So the output is as below:

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Note:</b> Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table <code>point</code>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Follow-up:</b> What if all these points have an id and are arranged from the left most to the right most of x axis?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
