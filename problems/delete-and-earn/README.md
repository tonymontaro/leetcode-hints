## [740. Delete and Earn (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn "删除与获得点数")

<p>Given an array <code>nums</code> of integers, you can perform operations on the array.</p>

<p>In each operation, you pick any <code>nums[i]</code> and delete it to earn <code>nums[i]</code> points. After, you must delete <b>every</b> element equal to <code>nums[i] - 1</code> or <code>nums[i] + 1</code>.</p>

<p>You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> nums = [3, 4, 2]
<b>Output:</b> 6
<b>Explanation:</b> 
Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.
Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]
<b>Output:</b> 9
<b>Explanation:</b> 
Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2&#39;s and the 4.
Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.
9 total points are earned.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Note:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>The length of <code>nums</code> is at most <code>20000</code>.</li>
	<li>Each element <code>nums[i]</code> is an integer in the range <code>[1, 10000]</code>.</li>
</ul>

<summary>Hint 1</summary>
If you take a number, you might as well take them all.  Keep track of what the value is of the subset of the input with maximum M when you either take or don't take M.
