## [393. UTF-8 Validation (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/utf-8-validation "UTF-8 编码验证")

<p>A character in UTF8 can be from <b>1 to 4 bytes</b> long, subjected to the following rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>For 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its unicode code.</li>
<li>For n-bytes character, the first n-bits are all one's, the n+1 bit is 0, followed by n-1 bytes with most significant 2 bits being 10.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:</p>

<pre><code>   Char. number range  |        UTF-8 octet sequence
      (hexadecimal)    |              (binary)
   --------------------+---------------------------------------------
   0000 0000-0000 007F | 0xxxxxxx
   0000 0080-0000 07FF | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0000 0800-0000 FFFF | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   0001 0000-0010 FFFF | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
</code></pre>
<p>
Given an array of integers representing the data, return whether it is a valid utf-8 encoding.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b><br />
The input is an array of integers. Only the <b>least significant 8 bits</b> of each integer is used to store the data. This means each integer represents only 1 byte of data.
</p>

<p>
<b>Example 1:</b>
<pre>
data = [197, 130, 1], which represents the octet sequence: <b>11000101 10000010 00000001</b>.

Return <b>true</b>.
It is a valid utf-8 encoding for a 2-bytes character followed by a 1-byte character.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<b>Example 2:</b>
<pre>
data = [235, 140, 4], which represented the octet sequence: <b>11101011 10001100 00000100</b>.

Return <b>false</b>.
The first 3 bits are all one's and the 4th bit is 0 means it is a 3-bytes character.
The next byte is a continuation byte which starts with 10 and that's correct.
But the second continuation byte does not start with 10, so it is invalid.
</pre>

### Hints
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
All you have to do is follow the rules. For a given integer, obtain its binary representation in the string form and work with the rules given in the problem.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
An integer can either represent the start of a UTF-8 character, or a part of an existing UTF-8 character. There are two separate rules for these two scenarios in the problem.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
If an integer is a part of an existing UTF-8 character, simply check the 2 most significant bits of in the binary representation string. They should be <b>10</b>. If the integer represents the start of a UTF-8 character, then the first few bits would be <b>1</b> followed by a <b>0</b>. The number of initial bits (most significant) bits determines the length of the UTF-8 character. 

<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> The array can contain multiple valid UTF-8 characters.

<details>
<summary>Hint 4</summary>
String manipulation will work fine here. But, it is too slow. Can we instead use <b>bit manipulation</b> to do the validations instead of string manipulations?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 5</summary>
We can use bit masking to check how many initial bits are set for a given number. <b>We only need to work with the 8 least significant bits as mentioned in the problem.</b>

<pre>
mask = 1 << 7
while mask & num:
    n_bytes += 1
    mask = mask >> 1
</pre>

Can you use bit-masking to perform the second validation as well i.e. checking if the most significant bit is 1 and the second most significant bit a 0?
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 6</summary>
To check if the most significant bit is a 1 and the second most significant bit is a 0, we can make use of the following two masks.

<pre>
mask1 = 1 << 7
mask2 = 1 << 6

if not (num & mask1 and not (num & mask2)):
    return False
</pre>
