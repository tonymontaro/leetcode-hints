## [599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-index-sum-of-two-lists "两个列表的最小索引总和")

<p>
Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings. 
</p>
<p>
You need to help them find out their <b>common interest</b> with the <b>least list index sum</b>. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.
</p>


<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]
<b>Output:</b> ["Shogun"]
<b>Explanation:</b> The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
<b>Output:</b> ["Shogun"]
<b>Explanation:</b> The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
</pre>
</p>


<p><b>Note:</b><br>
<ol>
<li>The length of both lists will be in the range of [1, 1000].</li>
<li>The length of strings in both lists will be in the range of [1, 30].</li>
<li>The index is starting from 0 to the list length minus 1.</li>
<li>No duplicates in both lists.</li>
</ol>
</p>
