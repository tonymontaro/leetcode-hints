## [76. Minimum Window Substring (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring "最小覆盖子串")

<p>Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input: S</strong> = &quot;ADOBECODEBANC&quot;, <strong>T</strong> = &quot;ABC&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;BANC&quot;
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string <code>&quot;&quot;</code>.</li>
	<li>If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.</li>
</ul>

### Hints
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Use two pointers to create a window of letters in <b>S</b>, which would have all the characters from <b>T</b>.

<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Since you have to find the minimum window in <b>S</b> which has all the characters from <b>T</b>, you need to expand and contract the window using the two pointers and keep checking the window for all the characters. This approach is also called Sliding Window Approach.

<br><br>
<pre>
L ------------------------ R , Suppose this is the window that contains all characters of <b>T</b> 
                          
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp L----------------- R , this is the contracted window. We found a smaller window that still contains all the characters in <b>T</b>

When the window is no longer valid, start expanding again using the right pointer. </pre>
