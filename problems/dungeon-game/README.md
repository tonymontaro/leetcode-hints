## [174. Dungeon Game (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game "地下城游戏")

<p>The demons had captured the princess (<strong>P</strong>) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (<strong>K</strong>) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.</p>

<p>The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.</p>

<p>Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (<em>negative</em> integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (<em>0&#39;s</em>) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight&#39;s health (<em>positive</em> integers).</p>

<p>In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Write a function to determine the knight&#39;s minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.</strong></p>

<p>For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least <strong>7</strong> if he follows the optimal path <code>RIGHT-&gt; RIGHT -&gt; DOWN -&gt; DOWN</code>.</p>

<table class="dungeon">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>-2 (K)</td>
			<td>-3</td>
			<td>3</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>-5</td>
			<td>-10</td>
			<td>1</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>10</td>
			<td>30</td>
			<td>-5 (P)</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The knight&#39;s health has no upper bound.</li>
	<li>Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.</li>
</ul>
