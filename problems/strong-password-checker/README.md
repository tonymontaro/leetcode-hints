## [420. Strong Password Checker (Hard)](https://leetcode.com/problems/strong-password-checker "强密码检验器")

<p>A password is considered strong if below conditions are all met:</p>

<ol>
<li> It has at least 6 characters and at most 20 characters. </li>
<li> It must contain at least one lowercase letter, at least one uppercase letter, and at least one digit. </li>
<li> It must NOT contain three repeating characters in a row ("...aaa..." is weak, but "...aa...a..." is strong, assuming other conditions are met). </li>
</ol>

<p>Write a function strongPasswordChecker(s), that takes a string s as input, and return the <b>MINIMUM</b> change required to make s a strong password. If s is already strong, return 0.</p>

<p>Insertion, deletion or replace of any one character are all considered as one change.</p>
