## [674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence "最长连续递增序列")

<p>
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest <code>continuous</code> increasing subsequence (subarray).
</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,3,5,4,7]
<b>Output:</b> 3
<b>Explanation:</b> The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [2,2,2,2,2]
<b>Output:</b> 1
<b>Explanation:</b> The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>
Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.
</p>
