## [602. Friend Requests II: Who Has the Most Friends (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/friend-requests-ii-who-has-the-most-friends "好友申请 II ：谁有最多的好友")

In social network like Facebook or Twitter, people send friend requests and accept others&#39; requests as well.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Table <code>request_accepted</code> holds the data of friend acceptance, while <b>requester_id</b> and <b>accepter_id</b> both are the id of a person.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date|
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |
</pre>
Write a query to find the the people who has most friends and the most friends number. For the sample data above, the result is:

<pre>
| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 3  | 3   |
</pre>
<b>Note:</b>

<ul>
	<li>It is guaranteed there is only 1 people having the most friends.</li>
	<li>The friend request could only been accepted once, which mean there is no multiple records with the same <b>requester_id</b> and <b>accepter_id</b> value.
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<b>Explanation:</b><br />
	The person with id &#39;3&#39; is a friend of people &#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39; and &#39;4&#39;, so he has 3 friends in total, which is the most number than any others.
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<b>Follow-up:</b><br />
	In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends, can you find all these people in this case?</li>
</ul>

### Hints
<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Being friends is bidirectional. If you accept someone's adding friend request, both you and the other person will have one more friend.
